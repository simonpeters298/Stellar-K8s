✨ feat(platform): end-to-end supply-chain provenance, immutable audit chain, adaptive HPA on custom SLIs, and multi-tenant fair-share scheduler (#1477 #1478 #1479 #1480)
• Merge branch 'main' into main
• merge: resolve upstream main into the job orphan detection branch
• merge: resolve upstream main into the multi-region failover branch
✨ feat(failover): health-gated incremental multi-region traffic shift plan
• - add the TrafficShiftPlan CR: a controller-owned, declarative plan that names
•   both regions, the weighted routing record, one health gate, the shift shape,
•   the failback policy and the declared RTO/RPO
• - health gate scores primary and secondary independently against the same
•   HealthGateSpec, and failback runs the identical function with the roles
•   swapped, so returning traffic needs the same evidence as taking it away
• - incremental shift state machine: drain, publish, soak; never moves weight
•   with the gate closed, never overshoots the target, and holds the last safe
•   increment when a soak breaches the error budget
• - connection draining and DNS TTL handled explicitly: the propagation wait is
•   max(ttl, soak) so a short soak cannot outrun resolver caches
• - render the weighted record declaratively as an external-dns DNSEndpoint and
•   record every step, gate decision, weight and RTO/RPO measurement in the plan
•   status, mirrored to a stellar.org/applied-traffic-record annotation
• - RTO measurement reports the overage, RPO evidence raises a Degraded
•   condition, and drill results render into the DR compliance report
• - 28 deterministic unit tests for the gate, both directions, the state
•   machine, drain/TTL math, record rendering and RTO/RPO reporting
✨ feat(jobs): Job/CronJob orphan detection with ownership reconciliation
• - add the JobRetentionPolicy CRD so every retention window is declarative
•   (completed jobs, failed jobs, stuck-job grace, terminal pods, scope label,
•   grace period, dry-run) instead of a hardcoded TTL
• - add a namespace-scoped reconciler with a pure planning core: a snapshot of
•   CronJobs, Jobs and Pods plus the policy yields a deterministic reclaim plan
• - classify all five orphan classes: deleted CronJob, broken ownerReference,
•   stuck failed job, completed pod, and namespace-move remnant
• - repair ownerReferences broken by partial deletions instead of only reporting
•   them, re-pointing at the live owner UID
• - never touch Active/Pending jobs or Running/Pending pods, and only reclaim a
•   terminal pod once its owning job is itself terminal
• - report reclaimed artifacts per namespace and per orphan class through new
•   Prometheus metrics, plus status conditions and requeue interval
• - 44 deterministic unit tests cover every orphan class, the safety properties,
•   determinism under a mid-cycle spec change, and the kube adapters

• [1520] [EPIC] Automated Dependency Upgrade Validation with Contract Tests
✨ feat(policy): versioned policy-as-code promotion pipeline (#1517)
• Policy changes were applied by editing YAML per environment by hand, so dev,
• staging and prod drifted and bad rules surfaced only in production. Model
• promotion as an artifact promotion flow instead.
• - Immutable, versioned bundles: PolicyBundle is content addressed over its
•   version and rules; is_intact() detects mutation and promote() refuses a
•   bundle edited after creation, so what staging validated is what prod gets.
• - Dry-run impact analysis: analyze_impact() evaluates a bundle against a
•   PolicyInventory per environment. It is pure and side-effect free, so CI can
•   run it on every change. An overbroad rule is blocked before enforcement.
• - Staged enforcement: every environment starts at Audit and advances exactly
•   one step per call (audit -> warn -> enforce), tracked per environment.
• - One-command rollback: rollback() restores the previous bundle in all
•   environments, resets enforcement to Audit, and reports the duration
•   against ROLLBACK_SLA_MS (60s).
• Promotion follows the dev -> staging -> production order and refuses to skip
• a link in the chain.
✨ feat(config): progressive config rollout with canary evaluation (#1519)
• Operator configuration used to be applied to every StellarNode at once, so a
• single bad setting took the whole fleet down. This reuses progressive-delivery
• machinery for configuration:
• - Canary first: select_canary() picks a deterministic subset whose size never
•   exceeds MAX_BLAST_RADIUS (5%) of the target set, spread across namespaces by
•   an even stride over the sorted target list.
• - Gates during the canary window: HealthGate/HealthSample evaluate the
•   canary. Passed promotes to Propagating, Failed or Incomplete never does.
• - Automatic rollback: gate_or_rollback() restores the previous bundle on gate
•   failure and records the measured duration against ROLLBACK_SLA_MS (30s).
• - Queryable versions: every target records the ConfigBundle version and digest
•   it is running, so 'which config is this node on?' is always answerable.
• - Stage machine (Idle -> Canary -> Propagating -> Complete, plus RolledBack)
•   guarantees no config change propagates without a gate pass.
• Merge origin/main into fix/1520-automated-dependency-upgrade-validation-with-contract-tests
🐛 fix(license): repair license headers with an import spliced into them
• Ten source files had use std::collections::BTreeMap; inserted as line 2,
• inside the Apache-2.0 header block and before the module's inner doc
• comment, which makes the inner doc comment a syntax error (E0753) and the
• whole crate fail to build. Move the import into the import block.
✨ feat(deps): automated dependency upgrade validation with generated contract tests (#1520)
• Replaces manual dependency upgrade reviews with a mechanical merge gate:
• - Contract test generation from existing consumer call sites, so the suite
•   tracks real usage without dedicated authoring effort.
• - Compatibility matrix auto-constructed from the generated suite.
• - Incompatible upgrades are blocked with consumer attribution (consumer name
•   plus the file:line call sites responsible).
• - Approved upgrades carry a signed validation artifact (suite digest,
•   matrix digest, SHA-256 signature).

✨ feat: add ledger migration and asset monitoring
✨ feat: implement Graceful Degradation Modes for Partial Control-Plane Outage
✨ feat: compliance reporting, validator scoring, partition response, and multisig coordination
• Implements comprehensive solutions for 4 major operator capabilities:
• 1. Compliance Reporting for Regulated Validators (#1581)
• - Added ComplianceReport Custom Resource Definition (compliance.stellar.org/v1alpha1)
•   supporting automated periodic audits on configurable daily/weekly/cron schedules.
• - Implemented RegulatoryReportGenerator in src/compliance/regulatory_report.rs to collect
•   operational metrics, uptime evidence against regulatory SLAs, key custody attestation

•   artifacts as Kubernetes ConfigMaps or object storage references.
• - Closes #1581
• 2. Validator Performance Scoring and Leaderboard (#1579)
• - Added ValidatorScore and ValidatorLeaderboard CRDs (stellar.org/v1alpha1) for automated
•   hourly validator performance grading and multi-cluster federation aggregation.
• - Implemented ValidatorScoringEngine in src/controller/validator_scoring.rs computing:
•   * Uptime availability scores from /info polling (>99% = A, 95-99% = B, 90-95% = C, <90% = F)
•   * Consensus participation rate from SCP nomination and ballot close metrics
•   * History archive checkpoint continuity and completeness scores
•   * Weighted composite performance score and letter grade (A+, A, B, C, D, F)
•   * Rolling 24-hour evaluation history

•   network and consensus incident lifecycle management.
• - Implemented PartitionIncidentDetector in src/incident/partition_detector.rs:
•   * Detects network partitions within 3 consecutive missed ledger closes (~15 seconds)
•   * Auto-dispatches emergency alerts to Slack, Webhook, and PagerDuty within 30s SLA
•   * Automatically populates Incident CR status with chronological diagnostic timelines
•   * Analyzes quorum health and computes safety-verified quorum adjustment recommendations
•     (adjusted validator sets and new Byzantine fault-tolerant thresholds).
• - Closes #1580
• 4. Multi-Signature Coordination for Administrative Operations (#1578)
• - Added MultiSigOperation Custom Resource Definition (stellar.org/v1alpha1) coordinating
•   M-of-N signature collection for administrative operations (settings upgrades, signer changes).
• - Implemented MultiSigController in src/controller/multisig_controller.rs:
•   * Gathers cryptographic signatures by querying signer sidecars or secret stores
•   * Enforces timeout deadlines and marks operations expired if threshold is unreached
•   * Exposes real-time partial signature progress (collected signatures, missing signers)
•   * Maintains an append-only audit trail recording actors, public keys, and timestamps
•   * Automatically submits assembled transactions to the Stellar network upon reaching quorum.
• - Closes #1578
✨ feat: implement Capacity Forecasting Engine with Quarterly Scaling Recommendations
✨ feat(schema): consumer-aware versioned schema registry with a PR compatibility gate
• - central registry snapshot covering every internal API subject, committed as
•   schemas/registry.json and enforced at build time by build.rs
• - deeper compatibility engine: nested objects, type changes, enum removals and
•   a dependency-free protobuf declaration check, across backward/forward/full
• - atomic registration that checks the subject policy, every pinned consumer and
•   an audited one-shot override before mutating state
• - explicit registry override required for any breaking change
• - generated clients are pinned to exact schema versions; floating refs rejected
• - consumer impact report attached to every registered version
• - new schema-compat CLI subcommand gates a proposed schema against all
•   consumers and emits the impact report
• - new InternalApiSchema CRD repeats the pin and enforcement policy at deploy
•   time, plus sample manifest, CRD YAML and design doc
✨ feat(webhook): declarative cert-manager TLS lifecycle with fail-closed cert health
• - render a bootstrap Issuer, a CA Certificate, a CA-backed Issuer and a
•   continuously renewed serving Certificate for the admission webhook
• - distribute the CA to every apiserver via cert-manager cainjector and
•   pin failurePolicy: Fail so TLS/trust errors never bypass admission
• - serve TLS with rustls through axum-server, reloading the mounted Secret
•   on rotation after draining in-flight connections
• - validate the serving identity before binding and fail closed otherwise
• - add a stellar-cert-health sidecar that pre-validates chain, validity, SAN
•   and EKU offline, gates readiness, and exports expiry-horizon metrics
• - alert at 25% and 10% of certificate lifetime remaining
• - reject --cert-path without --key-path at startup

• Merge branch 'main' into main
✨ feat(core): implement history archive compat, soroban rpc limits, captive core tuning, horizon failover
• Implement solutions for four core operator capabilities across history archive version
• validation, Soroban RPC limits and caching, captive core container tuning, and Horizon
• ingestion leader failover.
• Issue #1562 - History Archive Version Compatibility Checks
• - Problem: stellar-core 21.3.1 fails with "Unexpected history archive state version: 2" on SDF
•   archives generated by newer core binaries. Catch-up fails abruptly without pre-checks.
• - What was done:
•   * Implemented version compatibility validation in `src/controller/archive_health.rs` to detect
•     archive state version from `.well-known/stellar-history.json` before catch-up.
•   * Added compatibility matrix (`supported_archive_versions`): stellar-core < 22 supports archive
•     state version 1; core >= 22 supports versions 1 and 2.
•   * Added sidecar health check gating in `src/controller/health_check_sidecar.rs` and
•     `src/bin/stellar-health-sidecar.rs` with `/archive-compatibility` endpoint and 503 response on
•     `/readyz` when archive state version exceeds supported version.
•   * Updated `src/controller/reconciler.rs` to evaluate archive compatibility during reconciliation
•     and update status conditions (`ArchiveVersionCompatible`) with remediation recommendations.
• - How it was done:
•   * Parsed `.well-known/stellar-history.json` metadata (`version` and `server` fields).
•   * Compared archive version against core semver; surfaced clear errors including archive URL,
•     detected state version, supported versions, and recommended core upgrade.
• - Closes #1562
• Issue #1565 - Soroban RPC Caching and Pagination Limits
• - Problem: Soroban RPC `getEvents` and `getLedgerEntries` lacked pagination limits and caching,
•   risking OOM errors under heavy event stream querying or repeated ledger requests.
• - What was done:
•   * Added `maxPageSize` and `cacheSizeMB` configuration fields to `SorobanConfig` in
•     `src/crd/types.rs` with default values (100 items, 128 MB).
•   * Created `src/controller/soroban_rpc.rs` with cursor-based pagination and LRU cache.
•   * Implemented structured `EventCursor` (`{ledger:010}:{tx_index:06}:{event_index:04}`) for
•     efficient, deterministic cursor pagination.
•   * Implemented memory-bounded `LedgerEntryLruCache` tracking memory consumption in bytes against
•     the configured MB ceiling, along with hit/miss counters and hit ratio metrics.
•   * Injected `SOROBAN_RPC_MAX_PAGE_SIZE` and `SOROBAN_RPC_CACHE_SIZE_MB` env vars in
•     `src/controller/resources.rs`.
• - How it was done:
•   * Truncated responses exceeding `max_page_size` and computed `nextCursor` for event streams.
•   * Implemented entry byte size estimation for ledger keys and values to enforce memory bounding,
•     evicting oldest items when capacity is reached.
• - Closes #1565
• Issue #1563 - Captive Core Configuration Management
• - Problem: Horizon and Soroban RPC captive core configuration lacked explicit container-safe
•   paths (`DATABASE`, `BUCKET_DIR_PATH`, `TMP_DIR_PATH`) and worker thread CPU tuning.
• - What was done:
•   * Extended `CaptiveCoreConfig` in `src/crd/types.rs` with `database`, `bucket_dir_path`,
•     `tmp_dir_path`, and `worker_threads` fields.
•   * Enhanced `CaptiveCoreConfigBuilder` in `src/controller/captive_core.rs` with container
•     defaults (`/var/lib/stellar/buckets`, `/var/lib/stellar/tmp`, and `sqlite3://captivecore.db`).
•   * Implemented `derive_worker_threads_from_cpu` to scale worker threads based on allocated
•     container CPU cores (e.g. 500m -> 1, 2000m -> 2, 4 -> 4 threads).
•   * Injected captive core configuration hash annotation (`stellar.org/captive-core-config-hash`)
•     into Pod templates in `src/controller/resources.rs` to trigger graceful hot-reloads on spec
•     changes.
• - How it was done:
•   * Formatted captive-core TOML with explicit container paths and thread parameters.
•   * Derived thread count from pod resource limits/requests and wired into ConfigMap generation.
• - Closes #1563
• Issue #1564 - Horizon Ingestion Failover for Validator Groups
• - Problem: Running multiple Horizon replicas without ingestion leader election risked duplicate
•   ledger ingestion and database write conflicts.
• - What was done:
•   * Created `src/controller/horizon_failover.rs` implementing Kubernetes Lease-based leader
•     election for Horizon ingestion pods.
•   * Added `enable_ingestion_leader_election` and `ingestion_lease_duration_seconds` to
•     `HorizonConfig` in `src/crd/types.rs`.
•   * Designed ingestion role transition (`HorizonIngestionRole::Leader` vs `Standby`): leader runs
•     captive core ingestion while standby replicas operate in API-only mode without ingestion.
•   * Configured standby health checks to return HTTP 200 without ingestion error alerts.
•   * Injected leader election coordination environment variables in `src/controller/resources.rs`.
• - How it was done:
•   * Modeled lease renewal, acquisition, and heartbeat tracking with failover triggering in under
•     30 seconds upon leader lease expiration.
• - Closes #1564
• Closes #1562, #1565, #1563, #1564


## Chart v2.11.0 (2026-09-28) [minor]

• Merge pull request #1597 from susanyusuf/fix/1560-1561-config-scoping-and-peer-connectivity
• fix(config)+feat(peer): keep operator cfg keys at document root (#1560) and surface validator peer reachability (#1561)

• [1518] [EPIC] Deterministic Build Reproducibility Verification for All Artifacts
• Merge branch 'main' into fix/1518-deterministic-build-reproducibility-verification-for-all-artifacts
✨ feat(peer): surface validator peer reachability as a status condition
• A validator that cannot reach its peers produces no signal at all:
• stellar-core logs a failed overlay connection, the pod stays Ready, and the
• node is quietly absent from quorum. Blocked ports, wrong ports, DNS failures
• and a stale KNOWN_PEERS list all look identical from the outside, which is
• what makes them expensive to diagnose.
• Add controller::peer_connectivity, which TCP-dials each configured peer and
• reports the address, port, outcome and last attempt time per peer. Probes
• run at most MAX_CONCURRENT_PROBES at a time with a bounded timeout, so one
• blocked host cannot delay the rest, and results are returned in
• configuration order so the condition message is stable across rounds. The
• default 30s interval keeps two rounds inside the 60s detection budget the
• issue asks for.
• Wire it in on both sides the issue calls for:
• - Reconciler: update_status now folds the result into a PeerConnectivity
•   condition, using the existing conditions::set_condition so
•   last_transition_time is only bumped on a real transition. The condition is
•   removed rather than left stale for non-validators, suspended nodes and
•   validators with no peers.
• - Health sidecar: reads KNOWN_PEERS, runs its own probe loop and exposes
•   /peers. Readiness now fails when every configured peer is unreachable,
•   because a synced validator with no reachable peer cannot complete SCP.
•   Absence of probe data is not treated as failure, so sidecars that have not
•   completed a round, and nodes with no peers, are unaffected.
• Both derive their peer list from known_peers_for_node, and the operator
• renders that same list into the sidecar's KNOWN_PEERS env var, so the
• pod-local probe and the status condition cannot disagree about which peers
• are in play.
• remediation_hint names the port, the protocol and the likely cause: a
• security-group or NetworkPolicy rule blocking the overlay port, a peer
• listed on 11626 (the HTTP/admin port) instead of 11625, or a stale entry to
• refresh. Automatic remediation is deliberately not implemented - silently
• rewriting a user's peer list or port is a worse failure than a clear
• diagnostic, and the hint already states the exact change required.
• Closes #1561
🐛 fix(config): keep operator-managed stellar-core.cfg keys at the document root
• In TOML every key written after a table header belongs to that table. The
• operator appended CATCHUP_COMPLETE, CATCHUP_RECENT, HTTP_PORT_SECURE,
• TLS_CERT_FILE and TLS_KEY_FILE to the *end* of the user-supplied
• validatorConfig, so as soon as a user set [QUORUM_SET], [[VALIDATORS]] or
• [[HOME_DOMAINS]] every one of those keys was silently captured by the last
• table. The file still parsed and stellar-core still started, but with mTLS
• off, the wrong catch-up mode and no KNOWN_PEERS, and nothing reported the
• loss.
• Add controller::config_scope, which:
• - renders the operator keys through OperatorHeader and emits them *before*
•   user content, so they always land at the root;
• - re-parses the assembled document and reports any operator key that ended
•   up table-scoped (misplaced_operator_keys) plus any user key written after
•   a table header that stellar-core would read at the root
•   (orphaned_root_keys). Both are logged as warnings that name the node,
•   the key and the table that captured it. Restricting the orphan check to
•   keys stellar-core actually reads at the root keeps it actionable instead
•   of flagging legitimate table members such as THRESHOLD_PERCENT or TOML;
• - tolerates unparsable config by reporting it rather than failing a
•   reconcile.
• Cover the output with byte-exact golden files under
• tests/fixtures/stellar_core_cfg covering full history, recent history with
• mTLS, and an operator header with no user section, plus a structural
• assertion that every operator key present in the generated document is
• genuinely at the root.
• Closes #1560
🐛 fix(crd): remove duplicate service_ownership module and LedgerCloseWebhookSpec
• The crate did not compile on main: src/crd/mod.rs declared
• pub mod service_ownership; twice, and src/crd/ledger_close_webhook.rs
• carried a second empty LedgerCloseWebhookSpec unit struct whose
• CustomResource derive generated a resource type that shadowed the real
• spec struct.
• Move the CustomResource derive onto the actual LedgerCloseWebhookSpec• so the generated resource is built from the real schema, and drop the
• duplicate module declaration. Both are required before any other change
• can be validated by CI.
✨ feat(build): deterministic build reproducibility verification (#1518)
• Turns "rebuilds are reproducible" into a checkable property.
• - Independent rebuild pipeline: Pipeline/assert_independent() rejects a
•   verifier that reuses the release pipeline or builds a different revision.
• - Bit-for-bit comparison by SHA-256 plus a byte-level first-difference
•   offset, not by version or timestamp.
• - Mismatch localization: every mismatch is attributed to the build step that
•   emits the artifact, with the non-determinism sources detected in the
•   rebuilt bytes and the determinism flags that step fails to pin.
• - Per-release status and badge against REQUIRED_REPRODUCIBLE_RATE (95%).
• Non-determinism detection covers timestamps, leaked build paths, locale,
• VCS metadata, build ids, archive mtimes, mixed line endings and embedded
• random seeds, so a mismatch is attributed to a concrete cause.


## Chart v2.10.1 (2026-09-28) [patch]

• Merge pull request #1548 from itsnotOJ/fix/cleanup-935-936-934
🐛 fix: normalize Makefile targets, audit third-party licenses, and add integration test teardown
• Merge upstream/main into fix/cleanup-935-936-934
• Resolve conflicts in 11 files:
• - Makefile: take upstream's target set (doc-check/stale-docs targets,
•   security-fix, security-check and test-repo-health were removed upstream
•   along with the binaries/scripts they call), and keep the PR's additions
•   that are still valid: docs-lint in ci-local, the fixed help awk FS, the
•   pre-commit-install alias, run/run-local normalization, and a docker-multiarch
•   that builds locally with buildx (upstream's `gh workflow run release.yml`
•   cannot work - release.yml has no workflow_dispatch trigger).
• - Deleted docs: accept upstream's removal of CLEANUP_STATUS.md,
•   DEPENDENCY_SECURITY_AUDIT.md and docs/stale-docs-detector.md; drop the
•   dangling SECURITY.md link and the two stale CI-target bullets the PR added
•   to docs/development/makefile-refactoring.md.
• - Cargo.toml: anyhow = "1.0.104" (exactly matches Cargo.lock), bytes =
•   "1.11.1" (upstream's floor, satisfied by lock 1.12.1).
• - tests/backup_restore_smoke_test.rs: upstream's Apache license header plus
•   the PR's module docs; tests/cli_examples_test.rs: single top-level
•   `use assert_cmd::Command` (the mid-file copy would be a duplicate import).
• - CONTRIBUTING.md / DEVELOPMENT.md / CONVENTIONS.md / SECURITY.md: merge both
•   sides - upstream's command lists and conventions, PR's docs-lint detail,
•   install-crd fix and teardown conventions.

📝 docs: record cleanup status for issues 934, 935 and 936

• deliberately left undone, including the tests/e2e_kind.rs cluster leak and the
• undisclosed rdkafka/sasl2-sys/async-nats licenses.
• Signed-off-by: itsnotOJ <isnotoj1@gmail.com>
📝 test: add integration test teardown and repair uncompilable test files
• Partial progress on #934.
• Two test files could not compile. Both had content appended inside an
• unclosed function body, with a duplicated file header. "use" statements are
• not legal inside a function, so both were hard syntax errors:
• - tests/backup_restore_smoke_test.rs: fn stellar_operator() was never closed
•   and a second copy of the file header sat inside its body. Removed the dead
•   helper, the duplicated header, and three unused imports (std::fs, PathBuf,
•   TempDir). This target is invoked by ci.yml, so it was failing CI.
• - tests/cli_examples_test.rs: fn invalid_command_fails() was never closed and
•   "use assert_cmd::Command;" was stranded at column 0 inside its body. Closed
•   the function and moved the import to the top import block.
• Destructive side effects removed from ordinary cargo test:
• Four unit tests in tests/common/mod.rs built RAII guards to assert their
• fields and then let them Drop. Because every guard's Drop shells out to
• "kubectl delete", plain cargo test was deleting namespaces, StellarNode CRs
• and ConfigMaps from whatever cluster the developer's kubeconfig pointed at.
• Each test now ends with std::mem::forget, which suppresses the destructor. No
• guard API changed, so the E2E tests that depend on them are unaffected.
• Missing teardown primitive added:
• ensure_kind_cluster had no counterpart, so every KinD-backed test leaked a
• Docker container, network and volumes. Added to tests/common/mod.rs:
• - ClusterGuard: RAII guard owning a cluster for the life of a test, honouring
•   SKIP_TEARDOWN=1. That variable previously only suppressed inline teardown in
•   one file while leaving NamespaceGuard drops active, an inconsistent contract.
• - A private delete_kind_cluster helper, private on purpose so teardown goes
•   through the guard and also runs on panic.
• ClusterGuard wired in:
• - tests/quickstart_smoke_test.rs: all three tests called delete_kind_cluster
•   inline at the end of the body, so any failing assert! or wait_for_* leaked
•   the cluster. Replaced with a function-scoped guard and removed the now-unused
•   local delete_kind_cluster and skip_teardown helpers. The guard is bound to
•   the function scope, not the inner if block, so it is not dropped
•   immediately after creation.
• - tests/dr_failover_e2e.rs: guard registered immediately after cluster
•   creation so DrCleanup (namespaces and CRs) drops first and the cluster last.
• CONVENTIONS.md now documents ClusterGuard as mandatory, with correct and
• incorrect guard-scoping patterns and the mem::forget rule for unit-testing
• guards. It also carries the one-line operational-script example fix from #935.
• Known remaining leaks are listed in CLEANUP_STATUS.md and include
• tests/e2e_kind.rs, which still uses five copy-pasted local guard types and
• never deletes its cluster, and the chaos/soak workflows, which create KinD
• clusters with no teardown step.

📝 docs(licenses): correct third-party license audit findings
• Partial progress on #936. Scoped to non-breaking corrections.
• THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md is gated in CI by a byte-exact diff
• (make check-third-party-licenses) and the generator needs cargo-license, which
• is not available in the authoring environment. The generator was therefore
• deliberately NOT modified: changing it without regenerating the file would
• turn the gate red. The findings are documented instead.
• Corrected factual errors in DEPENDENCY_SECURITY_AUDIT.md:
• - The "23 known advisories" figure was wrong in three places. There is no single
•   list. The four ignore lists hold 20 (deny.toml), 26 (.cargo/audit.toml),
•   18 (ci.yml) and 15 (dependency-review.yml) entries. Replaced with the
•   measured table.
• - "anyhow 1.0.103 / bytes 1.11.1" was presented as version pinning for security
•   fixes. anyhow was in fact pinned to a non-existent 1.0.108 that broke
•   resolution outright; that is fixed in the preceding commit.
• - rustls-webpki was listed as two versions. The lock contains three
•   (0.101.7, 0.102.8, 0.103.13), and the stated target of >=0.103.12 is already
•   met by one of them.
• - rand 0.9.2 was stale; the lock has 0.8.6 and 0.9.4.
• - "Explicit handling of copyleft licenses" was not substantiated. Replaced with
•   an accurate note that ittapi and r-efi are permitted only because a
•   permissive OR branch is allowlisted.
• deny.toml, two false claims removed:
• - It asserted it was "in sync with .cargo/audit.toml" (it is missing 6
•   entries) and "in sync with the workflow cargo-audit --ignore lists"
•   (13 entries missing, and 5 appear only in CI). Replaced with the measured
•   divergence.
• - Flagged the pqcrypto ignores (RUSTSEC-2024-0380/-0381) as dead: no pqcrypto
•   package exists in Cargo.toml or Cargo.lock, so their "experimental pqcrypto
•   KMS path" justification describes a component that is not present.
• New "Open Gaps" section documents seven unresolved items with evidence. The
• most significant: rdkafka, sasl2-sys and async-nats are compiled by CI
• (.pre-commit-config.yaml runs cargo clippy and cargo test with
• --all-features) but are absent from the license file, because the generator
• pins a narrower feature set than what is actually built.
• Deliberately NOT changed: no deny.toml license exceptions were added. None are
• needed. cargo-deny satisfies an expression when any branch of an OR is
• allowlisted, so MIT OR Unlicense, BSD-3-Clause OR GPL-2.0 and
• Apache-2.0 OR BSL-1.0 already pass. Adding exceptions would be incorrect.

🐛 fix(makefile): normalize targets, remove deprecated and broken ones
• Fixes #935
• Bugs fixed:
• - docs-lint was defined twice with byte-identical recipes. GNU make silently
•   overrode the first and printed an "overriding recipe" warning on every
•   invocation, and make help listed the target twice.
• - make help used a non-portable awk field separator (FS = ":.*?## "). The lazy
•   quantifier is a GNU extension; under mawk (the Debian/Ubuntu default) and
•   BSD awk it is a literal, so the separator never matched and the entire
•   "All available targets" list silently vanished. Switched to the portable
•   form; verified no help text contains a second "## " so greedy-vs-lazy
•   splitting is equivalent.
• - make run-local ran the bare binary, but Args.command is a required clap
•   subcommand, so it exited with a usage error. run-local now passes "run" and
•   make run is a true alias, matching its own help text.
• - make docker-multiarch dispatched "gh workflow run multiarch-build.yml", but
•   that workflow does not exist in .github/workflows/, so the target could never
•   succeed. Replaced with a real local buildx build, which also matches what
•   DEVELOPMENT.md already claimed the target did. The phantom reference is
•   corrected in CI_COMMANDS.md and release.yml (the container job in release.yml
•   is the real multi-arch publisher).
• - soak-test.yml ran "bash scripts/soak-test.sh", but that file only existed at
•   scripts/archive/soak-test.sh. It is an operational script, not a one-off
•   bootstrap script, so the archive was the wrong home. Restored with git mv;
•   it has no self-relative path references, so the move is safe.
• Normalization:
• - Removed three duplicated recipe bodies: pre-commit-install and
•   dev-setup-hooks were byte-identical, and validate duplicated health-fast.
•   Both are now prerequisite-based aliases.
• - security-fix was documented as "Apply automated security fixes" but only ran
•   cargo update --dry-run and changed nothing. Help text corrected.
• - Added targets for things that were documented or referenced but unreachable:
•   list-doc-coverage (documented twice, target absent, wired to the existing
•   "doc-check list" subcommand), security-check (orphan script with no entry
•   point) and test-repo-health (a bats suite nothing ever ran).
• Docs synced:
• - CONTRIBUTING.md: "make install" -> "make install-crd" (no install target
•   exists); ci-local description now includes docs-lint.
• - docs/developer-onboarding/index.md: "make deploy" -> "make quickstart-deploy"
•   (no deploy target exists).
• - docs/stale-docs-detector.md: check-stale-docs is --warn-only and exits 0; the
•   strict gate is docs-check-strict; removed the false claim that these targets
•   are wired into ci-local.
• - SECURITY.md: replaced raw cargo deny/audit/outdated and the bare script path
•   with the canonical make targets.
• - makefile-refactoring.md: updated the CI target list to the targets actually
•   invoked by .github/workflows/*.yml.
• Note: the one-line CONVENTIONS.md operational-script example fix belongs to
• this issue but is committed with the test-teardown commit, to keep the change
• atomic per file.
• Verified: all 80 .PHONY entries have a target definition, a recipe and help
• text; zero duplicate target definitions; no space-indented recipe lines; all
• script references in the Makefile and in every workflow resolve.

🐛 fix(deps): repin anyhow and bytes to resolvable versions

• [1517] [EPIC] Versioned Policy-as-Code Promotion Pipeline from Dev to Prod
✨ feat(policy): versioned policy-as-code promotion pipeline (#1517)
• Policy changes were applied by editing YAML per environment by hand, so dev,
• staging and prod drifted and bad rules surfaced only in production. Model
• promotion as an artifact promotion flow instead.
• - Immutable, versioned bundles: PolicyBundle is content addressed over its
•   version and rules; is_intact() detects mutation and promote() refuses a
•   bundle edited after creation, so what staging validated is what prod gets.
• - Dry-run impact analysis: analyze_impact() evaluates a bundle against a
•   PolicyInventory per environment. It is pure and side-effect free, so CI can
•   run it on every change. An overbroad rule is blocked before enforcement.
• - Staged enforcement: every environment starts at Audit and advances exactly
•   one step per call (audit -> warn -> enforce), tracked per environment.
• - One-command rollback: rollback() restores the previous bundle in all
•   environments, resets enforcement to Audit, and reports the duration
•   against ROLLBACK_SLA_MS (60s).
• Promotion follows the dev -> staging -> production order and refuses to skip
• a link in the chain.

✨ feat(config): progressive config rollout with canary evaluation (#1519)
• Operator configuration used to be applied to every StellarNode at once, so a
• single bad setting took the whole fleet down. This reuses progressive-delivery
• machinery for configuration:
• - Canary first: select_canary() picks a deterministic subset whose size never
•   exceeds MAX_BLAST_RADIUS (5%) of the target set, spread across namespaces by
•   an even stride over the sorted target list.
• - Gates during the canary window: HealthGate/HealthSample evaluate the
•   canary. Passed promotes to Propagating, Failed or Incomplete never does.
• - Automatic rollback: gate_or_rollback() restores the previous bundle on gate
•   failure and records the measured duration against ROLLBACK_SLA_MS (30s).
• - Queryable versions: every target records the ConfigBundle version and digest
•   it is running, so 'which config is this node on?' is always answerable.
• - Stage machine (Idle -> Canary -> Propagating -> Complete, plus RolledBack)
•   guarantees no config change propagates without a gate pass.
• Merge origin/main into fix/1520-automated-dependency-upgrade-validation-with-contract-tests
🐛 fix(license): repair license headers with an import spliced into them
• Ten source files had use std::collections::BTreeMap; inserted as line 2,
• inside the Apache-2.0 header block and before the module's inner doc
• comment, which makes the inner doc comment a syntax error (E0753) and the
• whole crate fail to build. Move the import into the import block.
✨ feat(deps): automated dependency upgrade validation with generated contract tests (#1520)
• Replaces manual dependency upgrade reviews with a mechanical merge gate:
• - Contract test generation from existing consumer call sites, so the suite
•   tracks real usage without dedicated authoring effort.
• - Compatibility matrix auto-constructed from the generated suite.
• - Incompatible upgrades are blocked with consumer attribution (consumer name
•   plus the file:line call sites responsible).
• - Approved upgrades carry a signed validation artifact (suite digest,
•   matrix digest, SHA-256 signature).

• - Closes #1580
• 4. Multi-Signature Coordination for Administrative Operations (#1578)
• - Added MultiSigOperation Custom Resource Definition (stellar.org/v1alpha1) coordinating
•   M-of-N signature collection for administrative operations (settings upgrades, signer changes).

## Chart v1.3.2 (2026-09-02) [patch]

🐛 fix(ci): clean up redundant workflows, fix build, and resolve dependency issues
• - Delete 5 redundant workflows (wave-security-compliance, yaml-schema-validation,
•   k8s-manifest-validation, helm-drift-detection, db-migration-testing) as they
•   were duplicating functionality already covered by existing jobs
• - Fix Dockerfile stage numbering and comments for clarity
• - Fix bundle.Dockerfile metadata (Go -> Rust project layout)
• - Remove deprecated 'version' field from all 4 docker-compose files

•   signed_by() now takes (public_key, &Issuer) instead of (key_pair, ca_cert, ca_key_pair)
• Build verified on AWS EC2 VM (t3.xlarge, Ubuntu 22.04):
• - cargo build passes (dev profile)
• - Docker image builds successfully (74.6MB runtime image)
• - Helm chart lints clean, templates render correctly (1571 lines)
• Note: 30 pre-existing test compilation errors remain where test structs
• (ControllerState, AuditRecorder, AuditLog, AnomalyDetector) are out of
• sync with the actual code. These were never caught because the project
• could not build before the k8s-openapi fix.

• Document metric naming conventions and Grafana dashboard access
• Register Stellar Core crash-recovery chaos experiments in local runner
• Wire chaos engineering suite into make chaos-test
• Add unified developer environment setup script
✨ feat(helm): add pod-to-pod network policy enforcement (#1320)
• Enforce zero-trust pod-to-pod segmentation with default-deny and explicit
• allow rules for required service communication.
• - Add explicit egress allow rules to the operator default-deny for the
•   operator's required intra-cluster links (Redis rate limiting, Vault PKI,
•   OTel collector, Kafka SCP analytics), each gated on the matching feature
•   so the default render is unchanged.
• - Add templates/network-pod-policy.yaml implementing a per-namespace
•   default-deny (ingress+egress) baseline for any namespace listed in
•   security.networkPolicy.defaultDenyNamespaces.
• - Add helm-unittest coverage (network_policy_test.yaml, 11 tests).
• - Document the network topology and policy rationale in
•   docs/network-pod-to-pod.md and update related docs.
✨ feat(helm): harden automated chart release versioning (#1319)
• Implement the versioning.min-bump annotation as a minimum bump floor in
• bump-chart-version.sh, fix the root-commit exclusion that dropped the very
• first commit from analysis, and add bats coverage for the bump rules, the
• floor, and the --output-env mode.
• Also validate charts with helm lint --strict and helm unittest before
• publishing to the OCI registry, and register the new tests in CI and the
• Makefile.
📝 test(helm): add bump-chart-version tests and fix first-commit analysis
• Add bats coverage for scripts/bump-chart-version.sh (#1319) covering the
• SemVer bump rules (major/minor/patch/none), changelog generation, the
• --bump-override flag, --output-env GitHub Actions mode, and real Chart.yaml
• writes.
• Fix a bug where, before any chart-v* tag exists, the script used the root
• commit SHA as the analysis baseline which excluded the very first commit from
• the git log range. Leaving the baseline empty now analyzes all history.
✨ feat: implement structured error handling across all services
• Closes #1393.
• - Move ApiErrorCode/ErrorResponse into error.rs (unconditional) so both
•   rest_api and api_gateway share one definition instead of duplicating
•   it; rest_api::dto re-exports for compatibility. Add Error::status_code()
•   and Error::to_error_response() for consistent HTTP-code + JSON-envelope
•   mapping, plus ErrRateLimited/ErrGone codes.
• - Add correlation IDs: telemetry::resolve_correlation_id() reuses an
•   inbound X-Correlation-Id header or mints a UUID, http_trace_middleware
•   records it on the tracing span and echoes it back as a response header.
•   REST API handlers (list_nodes, get_node, set_log_level,
•   compliance_report) now populate ErrorResponse.correlation_id from it
•   instead of hardcoding None.
• - api_gateway::server: replace ad hoc (StatusCode, &str) responses with
•   the shared ErrorResponse envelope. Add graceful degradation: a
•   transform-response failure (we have upstream data, just couldn't
•   reshape it) returns ErrorResponse::degraded() with the raw upstream
•   body attached; an upstream-connection failure (no data, no cache)
•   returns a structured ERR_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE instead.
• - docs/errors.md: document the Error -> StatusCode/ApiErrorCode mapping,
•   gateway-specific codes, degradation semantics, and the correlation-ID
•   mechanism end to end.
• Validated with cargo check --locked --bin stellar-operator (clean).
• Full clippy/lint-strict and test suite were not run locally due to this
• host's disk constraints; deferred to CI.

🐛 fix: repair broken kube-rs APIs in tenant_reconciler and syntax error in backup
• tenant_reconciler.rs referenced APIs that don't exist in kube 0.94
• (kube::utils::json_patch::*, kube::api::ReplaceParams,
• kube::api::apiextensions_apiserver::...::CustomResourceDefinition) and
• tried to build k8s_openapi Quantity via a nonexistent From<String> impl,
• so the crate failed to compile on every branch. backup.rs had a stray
• closing brace and referenced an undefined variable. Neither bug is
• specific to any single wave issue; fixing both here since they block
• building this branch at all.
• Also sweeps in cargo fmt output for a few pre-existing formatting-drifted
• files (backup-verify.rs, changelog-gen.rs, conventional-commit-check.rs,
• controller/mod.rs) picked up while validating the build.

✨ feat(security): Soroban reentrancy guard middleware
✨ feat(security): add Soroban reentrancy guard middleware
• Implements a native reentrancy guard sub-contract middleware under
• wasm-plugins/security/reentrancy/, enforced through the Stellar-K8s custom
• validation (Wasm) layer (issue #8).
• - Storage-agnostic write-lock stack core that reverts nested, mutating
•   cross-contract re-entries of the same state variable while producing zero
•   false positives on non-mutating read callbacks.
• - ConfigMap-driven per-namespace / per-contract-ID scoping with a safe
•   "enabled everywhere" default and explicit opt-outs.
• - Optional 'soroban' feature binds the core to Soroban host instance storage
•   and compiles to a no_std (alloc) wasm32-unknown-unknown guest that ships a
•   minimal global allocator; overhead stays < 500 instructions (MAX_DEPTH=8).
• - Deliberately vulnerable mock vault plus a 19-unit/7-integration security
•   suite proving the exploit and its prevention.
• - ADR 0005 documenting the locking mechanism, plus deployable ConfigMap
•   example.
