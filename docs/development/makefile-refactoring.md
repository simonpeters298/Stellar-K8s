# Makefile Refactoring: Split Oversized Targets

## Overview

This document describes the refactoring of the Stellar-K8s Makefile to split oversized targets into smaller, composable commands. This improves maintainability, readability, and enables more flexible workflows.

## Changes Summary

### 1. Extracted Shared Variables

**Before**: 40+ lines of duplicated clippy flags between `lint` and `lint-strict` targets

**After**: Three shared variables eliminate duplication:
```makefile
CLIPPY_BASE_FLAGS := \
    -D clippy::correctness \
    -D clippy::suspicious \
    ... (15 flags total)

CLIPPY_STRICT_FLAGS := \
    -D clippy::complexity \
    -A clippy::cognitive_complexity \
    ... (4 additional strict flags)

CLIPPY_FEATURES := "rest-api,metrics,admission-webhook,k8s-v1-30,reconciler-fuzz"
```

**Benefits**:
- Single source of truth for clippy configuration
- Easier to update flags across all lint targets
- Reduced file size by ~40 lines

### 2. Split `quickstart` into Composable Phases

**Before**: Single 29-line monolith handling all quickstart logic

**After**: Four composable targets:
- `quickstart-setup`: Prerequisite checks and kind cluster creation
- `quickstart-build`: Build and load Docker image into kind
- `quickstart-deploy`: Deploy operator and sample resources
- `quickstart`: Orchestrates all phases (backward compatible)

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
# Full quickstart (backward compatible)
make quickstart

# Just create the cluster
make quickstart-setup

# Rebuild and reload image (skip cluster creation)
make quickstart-build

# Redeploy operator (skip build)
make quickstart-deploy
```

**Benefits**:
- Can run individual phases for debugging
- Faster iteration during development
- Clearer separation of concerns

### 3. Split `bundle` into Smaller Targets

**Before**: Single target with 4 distinct steps (render, generate, validate, cleanup)

**After**: Four focused targets:
- `bundle-render`: Render Helm chart to manifests
- `bundle-generate`: Generate OLM bundle from manifests
- `bundle-validate`: Validate generated bundle
- `bundle`: Orchestrates all phases (backward compatible)

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
# Full bundle generation (backward compatible)
make bundle

# Just render the manifests for inspection
make bundle-render

# Regenerate bundle after manifest changes
make bundle-generate bundle-validate
```

**Benefits**:
- Can inspect intermediate artifacts
- Easier to debug bundle generation issues
- Can re-run validation without regeneration

### 4. Split `completions` into Per-Shell Targets

**Before**: Single target generating all three shell completions

**After**: Four targets:
- `completions-bash`: Generate bash completion script
- `completions-zsh`: Generate zsh completion script
- `completions-fish`: Generate fish completion script
- `completions`: Orchestrates all shells (backward compatible)

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
# Generate all completions (backward compatible)
make completions

# Generate only bash completions
make completions-bash

# Generate only zsh completions
make completions-zsh
```

**Benefits**:
- Can generate completions for specific shell
- Faster iteration when working on one shell's completion logic
- Clearer error messages per shell

### 5. Split `dev-setup` into Logical Steps

**Before**: Single target with 3 distinct setup phases

**After**: Four targets:
- `dev-setup-rust`: Install Rust toolchain and components
- `dev-setup-tools`: Install development tools (cargo-audit, cargo-watch)
- `dev-setup-hooks`: Install git hooks (pre-commit)
- `dev-setup`: Orchestrates all steps (backward compatible)

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
# Full dev setup (backward compatible)
make dev-setup

# Just update Rust toolchain
make dev-setup-rust

# Install/update development tools
make dev-setup-tools

# Reinstall git hooks
make dev-setup-hooks
```

**Benefits**:
- Can re-run individual setup steps
- Faster when only one component needs updating
- Clearer what each step does

## Backward Compatibility

All original targets remain functional:
- `make quickstart` still works (orchestrates all phases)
- `make bundle` still works (orchestrates all phases)
- `make completions` still works (orchestrates all phases)
- `make dev-setup` still works (orchestrates all phases)

## CI/CD Impact

No changes required to CI workflows. The targets actually invoked from
`.github/workflows/*.yml` are:

- `make preflight`
- `make fmt-check`
- `make lint`
- `make lint-strict`
- `make check-third-party-licenses`
- `make check-api-docs`
- `make crd-gen`
- `make helm-lint`
- `make test`

Note: CI does **not** call `make build`; releases and CI builds go through the
`build-operator` composite action. The target remains available locally.

## Migration Guide

### For Developers

No action required! Existing workflows continue to work:
```bash
make quickstart      # Still works
make bundle         # Still works
make dev-setup      # Still works
```

### For Advanced Users

New composable targets enable more granular control:
```bash
# Debug quickstart by running phases individually
make quickstart-setup
make quickstart-build
make quickstart-deploy

# Skip phases that don't need re-running
make quickstart-build quickstart-deploy

# Run only specific bundle steps
make bundle-render
# Inspect rendered/manifests.yaml
make bundle-generate
```

## Testing

To verify the refactoring:

```bash
# Test backward compatibility
make quickstart      # Should work as before
make bundle         # Should work as before
make completions    # Should work as before
make dev-setup      # Should work as before

# Test new composable targets
make quickstart-setup
make quickstart-build
make quickstart-deploy

make bundle-render
make bundle-generate
make bundle-validate

make completions-bash
make completions-zsh
make completions-fish

make dev-setup-rust
make dev-setup-tools
make dev-setup-hooks

# Verify CI targets still work
make fmt-check
make lint
make lint-strict
make test
make build
```

- `CLEANUP_STATUS.md` - Overall cleanup status
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - CI workflow (no changes needed)

## Benefits Summary

1. **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused targets are easier to understand and modify
2. **Composability**: Can mix and match phases for custom workflows
3. **Debugging**: Can run individual steps to isolate issues
4. **Documentation**: Each target has a single, clear purpose
5. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing workflows continue to work
6. **CI Stability**: No changes required to CI/CD pipelines

## Cleanup Wave Changes (Issue #935)

### New Targets Added

The following targets were added during the cleanup wave to normalise the Makefile
and expose tooling that was previously only invocable via raw script paths.

| Target | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `check-openapi-spec` | `python3 scripts/generate-openapi-spec.py --check` | Validates OpenAPI spec coverage |
| `third-party-licenses` | `bash scripts/generate-third-party-licenses.sh` | Regenerates `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md` |
| `check-third-party-licenses` | `bash scripts/generate-third-party-licenses.sh --check` | CI gate: fails if licenses are stale |
| `generate-sbom` | `cargo cyclonedx` | Generates CycloneDX SBOM at `stellar-k8s.cdx.json` |
| `p2p-firewall` | `cargo build --release -p p2p-firewall` | Builds the P2P firewall binary |

### `.PHONY` Normalisation

All new targets were added to the `.PHONY` declaration at the top of the
Makefile to prevent Make from treating them as file build rules.

### Help Coverage

All targets include a `## description` comment so the `help` target (which
uses `awk` with `FS = ":.*?## "`) automatically includes them in its output.

### Background: License and SBOM Targets

`make third-party-licenses` and `make check-third-party-licenses` were previously
referenced in the auto-generated header of `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md` but no
Makefile targets existed for them.  The new targets close that gap.

`make check-third-party-licenses` is intended to be added as a CI check step
alongside `cargo audit` and `cargo deny` to ensure the license file never drifts
from the actual dependency tree.

### Background: p2p-firewall Target

The `security/p2p-firewall` crate is a workspace member.  `make p2p-firewall`
provides a short alias for building it without needing to remember the `-p` flag:

```bash
# Before (hard to discover)
cargo build --release --locked -p p2p-firewall

# After (discoverable via make help)
make p2p-firewall
```
