//! Job/CronJob orphan detection with ownership reconciliation (epic #1503).
//!
//! Batch workloads leave a lot of debris behind: terminal Jobs whose CronJob was
//! deleted, Pods whose Job was removed out from under them, Jobs stuck in
//! `Failed`, and terminal Pods that never got garbage collected. This module
//! finds that debris and reclaims it, driven entirely by the namespace-scoped
//! [`JobRetentionPolicy`] CRD — no TTL is hardcoded anywhere.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The module is split in two halves:
//!
//! 1. **A pure core** — [`ClusterView`], [`classify_job`], [`classify_pod`] and
//!    [`plan_reclaim`] — which turns a snapshot of Jobs, Pods and CronJobs plus
//!    a policy into a deterministic [`ReclaimPlan`]. No clock and no cluster
//!    access: `now` is always a parameter, so every rule is unit-testable.
//! 2. **A thin Kubernetes path** — [`collect_view`] reads the live objects with
//!    `kube`, [`apply_plan`] issues the deletes and owner-reference patches, and
//!    [`reconcile_job_retention`] ties it together with status and metrics.
//!
//! # Orphan classes
//!
//! | Class | Meaning | Action |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`OrphanClass::DeletedCronJob`] | Job's owning CronJob is gone | delete |
//! | [`OrphanClass::BrokenOwnerReference`] | `ownerReference` UID no longer resolves | repair (or delete) |
//! | [`OrphanClass::StuckFailedJob`] | `Failed` Job past the retention window | delete |
//! | [`OrphanClass::CompletedPod`] | terminal Pod of a terminal Job, past the pod window | delete |
//! | [`OrphanClass::NamespaceMove`] | remnant of an artifact moved out of its namespace | delete |
//! | [`OrphanClass::DeletedOwnerRemnant`] | artifact with no controller owner at all | delete (in scope only) |
//!
//! # Safety properties
//!
//! - An `Active`/`Pending` Job or a `Pending`/`Running` Pod is **never**
//!   deleted, whatever the policy says.
//! - A Pod is only reclaimed once its owning Job is itself terminal, so a Job
//!   that is still running its other pods is left alone.
//! - Classification is a pure function of a single snapshot, so a CronJob spec
//!   change that lands mid-cycle cannot produce a half-applied decision: the
//!   change is picked up by the next sweep, which re-lists everything.
//! - Artifacts with no controller owner are only touched when they carry the
//!   configured workload label, so hand-written Jobs and Pods are never deleted.
