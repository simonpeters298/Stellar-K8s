//! Cryptographic policy engine for runtime admission decisions (#1483).
//!
//! Policies are authored in a CEL subset, compiled into a signed bundle, and
//! verified against a configured trust root (Ed25519 keys from the existing
//! key-management / SecretPolicy inventory) before they can affect admission.
//! Invalid bundles never become active (fail-closed). Verified bundles are
//! cached in-process by digest so the signature is re-checked only when the
//! payload hash changes.
