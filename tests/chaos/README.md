# Chaos Engineering Test Suite

Stellar-K8s ships a continuous chaos testing suite built on
[Chaos Mesh](https://chaos-mesh.org). It proves the operator survives
catastrophic cluster events and always converges `StellarNode` resources back
to a healthy state.

## What each experiment verifies

### 01 — Operator Pod Kill
- **Chaos:** SIGKILL on the operator pod every 5s for 30s
- **Verifies:** Kubernetes restarts the operator; it re-reconciles all
  StellarNodes from scratch with no human intervention

### 02 — Network Partition
- **Chaos:** Full bidirectional TCP block between operator and K8s API for 60s
- **Verifies:** Operator handles `connection refused` gracefully; resumes after
  partition heals with no corrupt state

### 03 — API High Latency
- **Chaos:** 2000ms delay + 500ms jitter on every API call for 120s
- **Verifies:** Operator does not time out fatally, does not create duplicate
  resources, and eventually converges despite slow API

### 04 — Validator Peer Partition
- **Chaos:** Validator pods partitioned from each other (SCP peer ports) for 90s
- **Verifies:** Operator detects partition, updates StellarNode status, and
  recovers consensus after partition heals

### 05 — Disk Fill
- **Chaos:** Operator pod disk filled to capacity for 45s
- **Verifies:** Operator handles disk-full errors gracefully; does not crash or
  corrupt cluster state

### 06 — CPU Stress
- **Chaos:** 4 CPU workers at 90% load on the operator pod for 60s
- **Verifies:** Reconciliation loop continues under CPU pressure; no deadlocks

### 07 — Memory Pressure
- **Chaos:** 256 MB memory consumed on the operator pod for 60s
- **Verifies:** Operator is not OOM-killed; reconciliation continues

### 08 — Validator Pod Kill
- **Chaos:** Validator pods killed every 15s for 45s
- **Verifies:** Operator detects pod deaths, triggers StatefulSet re-creation,
  and updates StellarNode status correctly

### 09 — Cascading Failure
- **Chaos:** Simultaneous pod kill + network partition (worst-case scenario)
- **Verifies:** Operator restarts and reconnects; no split-brain or duplicate
  resource creation

### 10 — I/O Stress
- **Chaos:** Validator pod storage saturated with 4 concurrent I/O workers for 60s
- **Verifies:** Operator detects I/O degradation; does NOT delete the PVC;
  StellarNode recovers after stress ends

### 11 — Stellar Core Crash Recovery
- **Chaos:** Stellar Core process killed inside the validator pod
- **Verifies:** Core restarts and catches back up to the network without
  operator intervention or StellarNode status flapping

### 12 — Ledger Reconnection
- **Chaos:** Validator network access cut, then restored after falling behind
- **Verifies:** Core reconnects to peers and resyncs the ledger to the
  current close without manual resets

### 13 — Resource Exhaustion Recovery
- **Chaos:** Combined CPU/memory exhaustion on a validator pod
- **Verifies:** Pod recovers once pressure clears; StellarNode returns to
  Ready without stuck finalizers or duplicate resources

### 14, 15 — Control-Plane Component-Kill Matrix (#1494)
- **Chaos:** Each control-plane component isolated for 15 minutes with
  workload traffic held flat: DNS (14) and the admission webhook (15) via
  Chaos Mesh. etcd and the scheduler run as static pods, which Chaos Mesh
  cannot fail, so on kind they are isolated by moving the manifest aside:
  ```bash
  CP=stellar-chaos-control-plane   # kind control-plane container
  C=etcd                           # or kube-scheduler
  docker exec $CP mv /etc/kubernetes/manifests/$C.yaml /tmp/
  sleep 900
  docker exec $CP mv /tmp/$C.yaml /etc/kubernetes/manifests/
  ```
- **Verifies:** `ControlPlaneHealth/cluster` reports the declared level
  (etcd → Frozen, DNS → Degraded, webhook/scheduler → Reduced), the operator
  restarts no serving pods, pod startup is never blocked in Permissive webhook
  mode, and the level returns to Normal on its own with a post-incident report
  in `status.incidents`. These run 15 minutes each and need the webhook
  installed, so they are opt-in: `EXPERIMENTS="14 15" ./tests/chaos/run-chaos-tests.sh`.
  The same matrix runs in-process in
  `src/degradation/tracker.rs` (`chaos_matrix_each_component_isolated_for_15_minutes`).

## Running locally

You need only **Docker** installed. The script installs everything else.

```bash
# From the project root:
chmod +x tests/chaos/run-chaos-tests.sh
./tests/chaos/run-chaos-tests.sh

# Or via the Makefile target:
make chaos-test
```

The script will:
1. Check for `docker`, `kubectl`, `helm`, `kind`, `python3`
2. Create a 3-node kind cluster called `stellar-chaos`
3. Install Chaos Mesh and deploy the operator
4. Run all 13 experiments in sequence
5. Generate a resilience report in `tests/chaos/results/<run-id>/`

### Options

```bash
# Skip cluster creation (cluster already running)
SKIP_SETUP=true ./tests/chaos/run-chaos-tests.sh

# Run only specific experiments
EXPERIMENTS="01 02 09" ./tests/chaos/run-chaos-tests.sh

# Skip specific experiments (e.g. skip cascading failure)
SKIP_EXPERIMENTS="09" ./tests/chaos/run-chaos-tests.sh

# Custom recovery timeout
RECOVERY_TIMEOUT=600 ./tests/chaos/run-chaos-tests.sh
```

### Running a single experiment manually

```bash
# Apply the experiment
kubectl apply -f tests/chaos/01-operator-pod-kill.yaml -n chaos-testing

# Wait for it to finish
sleep 40

# Remove it
kubectl delete -f tests/chaos/01-operator-pod-kill.yaml -n chaos-testing

# Check operator recovered
kubectl get pods -n stellar-system
kubectl get stellarnode --all-namespaces
```

### Cleanup

```bash
kind delete cluster --name stellar-chaos
```

## Running in CI (GitHub Actions)

The workflow lives at `.github/workflows/chaos-tests.yml`.

**Triggers:**
- **Nightly** — every day at 02:00 UTC automatically
- **Manual** — Actions → Chaos Engineering Tests → Run workflow

**Parallel execution:** Experiments run in 3 parallel groups on separate kind
clusters to keep total CI time under 90 minutes:

| Group | Experiments |
|-------|-------------|
| A | 01 Pod Kill, 02 Network Partition |
| B | 03 API Latency, 04 Peer Partition, 05 Disk Fill |
| C | 06 CPU Stress, 07 Memory Pressure, 08 Validator Kill, 09 Cascading, 10 I/O |

**Skipping experiments:** When triggering manually, enter a comma-separated list
of experiment IDs in the "skip_experiments" input (e.g. `"09,10"`).

## Resilience Report

After each run, `generate_report.py` produces:

- `resilience-report.md` — human-readable Markdown with per-experiment scores
- `resilience-report.json` — machine-readable JSON for trend tracking

### Scoring rubric

| Condition | Score impact |
|-----------|-------------|
| System recovered within SLO | 100 pts |
| Recovered but SLO breached | 70–99 pts (proportional to overshoot) |
| System did not recover | 0 pts |

**Weighted overall score:** Critical experiments count 3×, High 2×, Medium 1×.

### Score interpretation

| Score | Verdict |
|-------|---------|
| 90–100 | 🟢 Excellent |
| 70–89 | 🟡 Good |
| 50–69 | 🟠 Fair |
| 0–49 | 🔴 Poor |

## Interpreting logs

**Healthy recovery after pod kill:**
```
WARN reconciliation error ... connection refused
INFO Reconciling StellarNode stellar-system/chaos-test-horizon
INFO Applied StellarNode: stellar-system/chaos-test-horizon
```

**Healthy recovery after network partition:**
```
WARN KubeError: ... timeout
WARN KubeError: ... connection refused
INFO Reconciled: ObjectRef { name: "chaos-test-horizon" ... }
```

**Red flags (experiment failed):**
- Operator pod stays in `CrashLoopBackOff` after chaos ends
- StellarNode stuck in `Failed` phase after the recovery timeout
- Duplicate Deployments or Services created
- Finalizers stuck preventing StellarNode deletion
- `panic` in operator logs
